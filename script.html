  <h1>🎤 4-Minute Presentation Script</h1>

  <h2>Slide 1</h2>

  <p><span class="cue">(Friendly tone, confident posture)</span><br>
  “Good morning everyone.</p>

  <p>Today, I’ll be talking about <em>Cindy Yardley</em>, the software tester involved in the infamous <em>Killer Robot</em> case — and how pressure, fear, and ethical choices played a major role in what happened.”</p>

  <p><span class="cue">(Brief pause)</span><br>
  “Cindy was responsible for testing the code written by <em>Randy Samuels</em> for the robot project.
  But instead of testing the actual software, she ran tests using a simulation of it — which meant the real code was never properly verified.”</p>

  <p><span class="cue">(Slightly serious tone)</span><br>
  “From leaked emails between Cindy and <em>Ray Johnson</em>, the Robotics Division Chief, we now know this approach was <em>Ray’s idea</em>.
  He followed an ideology called the <em>‘Ivory Snow Theory’</em>, which I’ll explain later.</p>

  <p>But what’s important here is that this idea — combined with strict project deadlines — created a <strong>climate of fear</strong>. Cindy and her colleagues were terrified that if they didn’t deliver results, or if they exposed problems, they’d be fired.”</p>

  <p><span class="cue">(Pause, empathetic tone)</span><br>
  “So under that pressure, Cindy made the decision to falsify her test results — presenting simulation data as if it came from real tests.”</p>

  <p>“This choice had serious consequences. Professionally, it undermined the reliability of the software and destroyed trust between Cindy and her team.
  It also damaged her credibility and put the company’s reputation at risk.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the falsified results meant critical safety flaws went undetected — and the robot’s malfunction later caused a death that could have been prevented.”</p>

  <p><span class="cue">(Transition tone)</span><br>
  “Sadly, the ethical failures didn’t stop there.”</p>

  <h2>Slide 2</h2>

  <p><span class="cue">(Curious tone)</span><br>
  “Not long after the incident, <em>Max Worthington</em>, the Chief Security Officer at Silicon Techtronics, announced his resignation — with the statement, <em>‘I am Martha.’</em>”</p>

  <p><span class="cue">(Pause)</span><br>
  “Martha was the alias used by an anonymous insider who leaked information about the Robbie CX30 robot project to the <em>Silicon Valley Sentinel-Observer</em>, the newspaper covering the Killer Robot case.”</p>

  <p>“Max revealed that he was the source of those leaks — including the private emails between employees discussing project issues and even personal matters.”</p>

  <p><span class="cue">(Shift to analytical tone)</span><br>
  “From a <strong>data ethics perspective</strong>, this was a massive <strong>GDPR violation</strong>.
  Those emails contained personal and sensitive information. Sharing them publicly breached confidentiality and trust, and under today’s laws, would be clearly illegal.”</p>

  <p><span class="cue">(Transition to BCS analysis)</span><br>
  “When we look at Cindy’s actions through the <em>BCS Code of Conduct</em>, several ethical breaches become clear.”</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Public Interest</strong> — By falsifying test results, Cindy put the public in danger. As computing professionals, our responsibility to protect people always comes before loyalty to managers or deadlines.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional Competence and Integrity</strong> — She knowingly presented false data as genuine, violating one of the most fundamental principles of our profession — honesty.</li>
    <li><strong>Duty to Relevant Authority</strong> — Even under pressure, Cindy should have reported the issue or escalated it responsibly. The BCS Code makes it clear: we must raise concerns, not conceal them.</li>
    <li><strong>Duty to the Profession</strong> — By falsifying results, Cindy didn’t just harm her own career — she damaged public trust in software engineers and the computing industry as a whole.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><span class="cue">(Pause, then concluding tone)</span><br>
  “In the end, the Killer Robot case shows how fear and pressure can erode ethical judgment.
  It reminds us that integrity must come before convenience, and that the cost of unethical decisions can be far greater than the fear of speaking up.”</p>

  <p><span class="cue">(Smile slightly)</span><br>
  “Thank you for listening.”</p>

  <p><strong>✅ Total Time:</strong> ~3 minutes 55 seconds when spoken at a normal pace (with short pauses).</p>
