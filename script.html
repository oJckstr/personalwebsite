  <h1>Slide 1</h1>

  <p class="tone">(Friendly tone, confident posture)</p>
  <p><strong>Good morning everyone.</strong></p>

  <p>Today, I’ll be talking about <strong>Cindy Yardley</strong> — the software tester involved in the infamous <em>Killer Robot</em> case — and how <strong>pressure, fear, and ethical choices</strong> played a major role in what happened.</p>

  <p class="tone">(Brief pause)</p>
  <p>Now, imagine being in Cindy’s position. You’re responsible for testing complex code written by another engineer, Randy Samuels. But instead of testing the real software, you’re told to use a simulation. <strong>What could possibly go wrong, right?</strong></p>

  <p class="tone">(Slightly serious tone)</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, quite a lot. Because those tests — which were supposed to verify the robot’s safety — never actually tested the real thing.</p>

  <p>From leaked emails between Cindy and <strong>Ray Johnson</strong>, the Robotics Division Chief, we now know that this approach wasn’t Cindy’s idea. It came from Ray, who followed something called the <strong>“Ivory Snow Theory”</strong> — an ideology I’ll explain shortly.</p>

  <p class="tone">(Pause, thoughtful tone)</p>
  <p>But here’s the bigger question: <strong>what happens when deadlines matter more than doing things right?</strong></p>

  <p>Inside that company, pressure was sky-high. People were afraid to speak up, terrified that if they exposed problems, they’d lose their jobs.</p>

  <p class="tone">(Empathetic tone)</p>
  <p>So under that fear, Cindy made a choice — to <strong>falsify her test results</strong>, presenting simulated data as if it came from real tests.</p>

  <p><strong>Why does that matter?</strong> Because this one decision didn’t just break trust within the team — it <strong>compromised the software’s reliability</strong> and <strong>the company’s reputation</strong>.</p>

  <p class="tone">(More serious tone)</p>
  <p>And the worst part? Those falsified results meant <strong>critical safety flaws went unnoticed</strong>. The robot malfunctioned. And someone died — a tragedy that could have been prevented.</p>

  <p class="tone">(Transition tone)</p>
  <p>Sadly, the ethical failures didn’t stop there.</p>

  <hr>

  <h1>Slide 2</h1>

  <p class="tone">(Curious tone)</p>
  <p>Not long after the incident, another twist emerged. <strong>Max Worthington</strong>, the Chief Security Officer at Silicon Techtronics, suddenly resigned — and his statement was just three words:</p>

  <blockquote>“I am Martha.”</blockquote>

  <p>Now you might wonder… <strong>who’s Martha?</strong></p>

  <p class="tone">(Pause)</p>
  <p>Martha was the alias used by an insider who leaked confidential information about the robot project to the <em>Silicon Valley Sentinel-Observer</em> — including <strong>private emails between employees</strong>.</p>

  <p class="tone">(Reflective tone)</p>
  <p>So here’s another question: <strong>was Max doing the right thing by exposing the truth, or was he crossing a serious ethical line?</strong></p>

  <p class="tone">(Shift to analytical tone)</p>
  <p>From a data ethics perspective, this was a <strong>major breach</strong>. Those emails contained personal and sensitive information — and sharing them publicly would absolutely violate today’s <strong>GDPR laws</strong>. In other words, even with good intentions, it was still wrong.</p>

  <p class="tone">(Transition to BCS analysis)</p>
  <p>So, what can we learn from Cindy’s decisions when we look through the <strong>BCS Code of Conduct</strong>?</p>

  <h3>Public Interest</h3>
  <p>By falsifying test results, Cindy endangered the public. <strong>Shouldn’t protecting people always come before meeting deadlines?</strong></p>

  <h3>Professional Competence and Integrity</h3>
  <p>She knowingly presented false data as genuine. <strong>If honesty is the foundation of our profession, what happens when that foundation cracks?</strong></p>

  <h3>Duty to Relevant Authority</h3>
  <p>Even under pressure, Cindy could have reported her concerns. The Code tells us clearly: <em>we must raise issues, not hide them.</em></p>

  <h3>Duty to the Profession</h3>
  <p>By falsifying results, she didn’t just hurt herself — she <strong>weakened public trust</strong> in all of us as computing professionals.</p>

  <p class="tone">(Pause, then concluding tone)</p>
  <p>In the end, the Killer Robot case reminds us of something simple but powerful: <strong>fear can cloud judgment, but integrity must always come first.</strong></p>

  <p>Because in the long run, <strong>the cost of doing the wrong thing is far greater than the fear of speaking up.</strong></p>

  <p class="tone">(Gentle smile)</p>
  <p><strong>Thank you for listening.</strong></p>

  <h1>Tips for Managing Nerves</h1>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>🫁 Mark breathing points</strong> — Each rhetorical question is a natural pause; take a breath before continuing.</li>
    <li><strong>✋ Keep your hands occupied</strong> — Hold a clicker or pointer to reduce fidgeting.</li>
    <li><strong>👀 Look at friendly faces first</strong> — It helps you warm up before addressing the whole group.</li>
    <li><strong>😊 Smile when you begin and end</strong> — It signals confidence, even if you’re nervous inside.</li>
    <li><strong>👥 Practice with your group</strong> — Familiar rhythm = less panic on stage.</li>
  </ul>
