        <h1>What is Sandal Castle?</h1>
        <p class="main">Located in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, Sandal Castle is a ruined medieval fortress with deep ties to English royal history and civil war. </p>
        <p class="main">Name origin: “Sandal” derives from the Old Scandinavian sandr (“sand/gravel”) + healh (“meadow”).</p>

        <div class="text-box">
        <h1>Origins and Architecture</h1>
    <p class="main">The site was first fortified by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey. He was granted the Sandal estates around 1107 and built the original timber motte-and-bailey fortress atop a 10m artificial mound. </p>
    <img class="inside-txt-small" src="/img/william_de_warenne.jpeg" alt="William De Warenne">
    <p class="main">Under Hamelin de Warenne and his descendants, the timber defences were replaced by stone, with a new barbican, stone keep, great hall, kitchen, stables and inner moat added by the late 1200s.</p>

        <p class="main">Richard, Duke of York, used the castle as his winter base. He led his army out from its gates to confront a Lancastrian force, only to be overwhelmed and killed nearby.</p>
        <p class="main">His head (and those of his son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury) were displayed on Micklegate Bar in York - Richard's on a pike with a paper crown placed upon it.</p>

        <h1>English Civil War (1645)</h1>
    <p class="main">Briefly reused by Royalist forces, the castle was partially demolished (“slighted”) after Parliamentarian capture, contributing to its ruined state today. Parliament ordered it largely demolished to prevent further military use.</p>

        <p class="main">Richard III's enhancements (1484-85): He added a polygonal tower and bakehouse to reinforce its northern role, though work ceased after his defeat at Bosworth in 1485.</p>
